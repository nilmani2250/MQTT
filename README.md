# MQTT WiFi Publisher/Subscriber in C


## Abstract

This project demonstrates the development of a basic message communication system over WiFi using the **MQTT protocol** in the **C programming language**. 
It includes two components: a publisher and a subscriber, which communicate through a central MQTT broker. 
The system is designed for lightweight IoT communication and can be extended for real-time sensor data transmission or command-based communication.


##  Objectives

- To understand and implement MQTT protocol in C.
- To create a configuration-based client system.
- To build two components: publisher and subscriber.
- To simulate message passing over MQTT topics.
- To understand how MQTT brokers like Mosquitto work in practice.
